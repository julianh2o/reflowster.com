<span class="tagline">Our <img height="20px" src="/resources/images/kickstarter-logo-light.png" /> campaign is now live!</span>

After a month and some change of preparation, we've finally launched our Kickstarter campaign! Be sure to watch our video on Kickstarter and support
us on our <a href='{{ site.kickstarterurl }}'>Kickstarter campaign page</a>

On our Kickstarter page, you'll find a thorough description of our project and information about the backing levels. We're aiming for a goal of $10,000
which will ammount to around 100 units. If we make our goal, we plan on using reflowster.com to continue to sell Reflowster in case you missed the Kickstarter.

Additionally, Kickstarter provides an area for backers to ask us questions about Reflowster. If you ask a particularly good question we'll add it to the FAQ.
