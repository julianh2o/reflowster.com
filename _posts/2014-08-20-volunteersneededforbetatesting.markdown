title:  "Volunteers needed for Beta Testing!"
categories: news
---

<p>Our firmware is pretty decent at this point, so we're looking for some volunteers who might want to receive their Reflowster early and help us look for bugs in the code, improve the user guide, and generally help us out with any insights or ideas you might have.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>If you're selected for beta testing, we will ship you your entire reward early with a "preproduction" unit. This unit is virtually identical to the final design, but will be running an early version of the firmware. This firmware can easily be updated at any time.</p>

<p>Volunteers should be prepared to load new firmware via USB if necessary.Â </p>

<p>We only have a few units ready at this time. If you want to volunteer, send us a message with your shipping information and we'll set you up!</p>
