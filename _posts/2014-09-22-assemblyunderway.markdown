<p>This past month we've had our noses to the grindstone assembling Reflowsters. There have unfortunately been a few minor setbacks, but fortunately most of these were identified and accounted for early in the process. Ultimately these issues resulted in us having to go back over the circuit boards by hand after we've completed the reflow process in order to get the boards passing our tests.</p>

<p>In the upcoming weeks, we'll continue to assemble boards and are planning to start shipping out the Special Edition package to our higher-tier backers soon. Once those orders are shipped, we'll be shipping to small batches of our other backers as the Reflowsters are tested and ready.</p>
