<p>At long last, Reflowster is ready for preorder. We'll be gathering up a production run with an estimated ship date of February or March 2015. Since we've manufactured all previous Reflowsters by hand in California, this next batch preorder is going toward filling out a full production run with a factory overseas.</p>

<p>We've already started the ball rolling with our factory and will be spending the next few weeks getting them the final details they need to assemble a batch of Reflowsters. While we don't expect to take until March to get this run delivered, we've allowed ourselves some extra time to handle any surprises that we might run into during our first time working with this factory.</p>
