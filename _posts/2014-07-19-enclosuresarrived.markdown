<p>The cases have arrived and our circuit board fits perfectly. Here is the box of ABS enclosures that showed up on my doorstep the other day.</p><img class="showcase" src="/resources/images/updates/update_07_19_2014_1.jpg">
<p> Despite the fact that we carefully planned, checked, and double checked all of our measurements, we were quite relieved when the circuit board fit perfectly into the case.</p><img class="showcase" src="/resources/images/updates/update_07_19_2014_2.jpg">

<p> In addition to getting the cases in, we've just shipped off the design for our latest and (hopefully) final version of our PCB. The changes we made for this revision were extremely minor. Most of the board is set in stone at this point. For this revision the only things that changed was swapping one capacitor out for another, adding a stray resistor to help with some minor programming issues, and replacing one USB connector for one of higher quality.</p><p>Slightly less exciting than all of that, but no less necessary for shipping, we've finalized and ordered our sticker designs. We have three sticker designs. Each Reflowster will ship with one of each sticker.</p><img class="showcase" src="/resources/images/updates/update_07_19_2014_4.jpg">
<p> The sticker order has been placed and we're expecting them to show up any day now.</p><p>Another item that we've been working on to include with Reflowster is a mini booklet containing some of the wisdom that we've managed to accumulate throughout our experience with reflow soldering at home. We're the first to admit that we're by no means experts when it comes to reflow soldering, but we definitely feel like we've gotten the hang of it by now and have come up with some tips and tricks that will help you get started or refine your technique. This document, as well as the Reflowster manual will both ship with Reflowster and be available online.</p><p>Last but not least, we've been working to refine Reflowster's library and base firmware code. All of the code will be open source and will consist of two parts. The first part will be a library that gives access to all of the hardware features of Reflowster. This library will be useful for anyone interested in repurposing Reflowster for something other than reflow soldering. The second part, hosted in a second repository, will contain the base firmware that Reflowster will run out of the box. This will include all of the logic for handling the Reflowster menus and the reflow process itself. You may be interested in this if you are interested in updating your version of the firmware or tweaking the behavior of Reflowster.</p><p>We're proud to say that we're still quite a bit ahead of schedule and expect to ship within the next 3 months.</p><p>Team Reflowster</p>
