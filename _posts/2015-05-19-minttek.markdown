Reflowster is teaming up with <a href="http://mint-tek.com/">Mint Tek Circuits</a> to make purchasing Reflowsters in Europe easier. Mint Tek will be selling Reflowsters on their <a href="http://mint-tek.com/reflowster/">web store</a> which will avoid prohibitive international shipping costs and delays.

<a href="http://mint-tek.com/">Mint Tek Circuits</a> is an exciting startup in Ireland that's dedicated to bringing you quick and easy turn around for your PCB Prototyping needs. They do the legwork for hunting down a supplier and managing requirements. Furthermore, they've been active in the maker community by attending faires, aggregating maker-centered events, and blogging maker-relevant news.

They put Reflowster to the test by soldering upwards of 50 PCBs in a single day at Maker Faire UK 2015. You can read all about their booth at the faire in the <a href="http://mint-tek.com/maker-faire-uk-2015/">blog post about it</a>.
