Thanks to all of our backers for making our Kickstarter campaign such a huge success. In just 28 days,
we managed to reach $15,674, almost 157% of our original goal with a grand total of 192 backers.
Not only did we get our funding, we've gotten valuable feedback from our backers throughout the campaign and ended the campaign with a significantly
redesigned vision for Reflowster.

We're already well underway with a new prototype in the mail. As soon as it arrives, we'll be assembling it and testing it before moving on to either
another revision or our certification process. Concurrently, we'll be working out the details of the custom machining and printing of our enclosure.

If you missed the Kickstarter and want a Reflowster, be sure to subscribe to our mailing list to be notified when Reflowster is available for orders.
