Reflowster quickly and easily turns your unmodified toaster oven into a reflow soldering station. Using a relay to control power to the oven and a thermocouple to measure the temperature inside the oven. Reflowster is ready to go in minutes and can cheaply and effectively solder any number of hobby projects. This allows you to avoid the tedium of hand-soldering a surface-mount PCB and the high cost of a commercially available reflow oven.

Reflowster's encoder and LED display allow you to navigate menus and use either a standard soldering profile or your own custom profile. Once the reflow process is started, Reflowster switches the power to the toaster oven on until a soak temperature is reached. Reflowster waits for the configured soak duration and then turns the oven back on until the peak temperature is reached.
