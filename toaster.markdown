Reflowster does need to be paired with a toaster oven to work, but unlike many DIY solutions Reflowster requires NO toaster modification.  No need to cut cables or risk electrocution!

Reflowster may not work perfectly with every toaster oven, but we've found that smaller, cheaper ovens typically work great because they allow for faster changes in temperature. Most simple toaster ovens without digital controls will work. In particular, a toaster that can be stuck in the "on" position is required. This state needs to persist through a power cycle. Most toasters do this by turning the timer knob backwards.

The toaster oven that we are using is pretty much the cheapest one we could order on Amazon: [Proctor Silex 31111](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O0ANH2).

**Remember:** Using a toaster oven for reflow soldering can release poisonous fumes. It is strongly advised that you label any toaster oven you use for reflow soldering as "not for food use". We plan on shipping stickers with Reflowster to help you mark your toaster oven.
