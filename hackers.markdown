Because Reflowster is fully compatible with the Arduino IDE, new code can easily be uploaded to re-purpose Reflowster to do anything you can think of. The thermocouple, relay, LED display, and encoder make Reflowster a perfect platform for a variety of alternative projects. We only provide the firmware for performing a reflow soldering job, but with a little imagination and some programming, a variety of projects are possible. Here are some ideas:

<ul>
<li>A temperature controlled fan
<li>A circadian light timer
<li>An outlet with an automatic shutoff
<li>An easy bake oven
<li>An incubator
<li>A sous-vide machine
<li>Curing carbon fiber
</ul>
