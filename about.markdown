**Julian Hartline** (left) has a degree in Computer Science and has been programming for 17 years, 5 of which have been in the industry. He specializes in designing and building robust APIs and sleek and intuitive user interfaces. He's been heavily involved in the hardware and PCB design scene for the last 2 years as a hobbyist. He has been doing the bulk of the programming and has been taking charge of getting the first drafts of the PCBs ready for Tony to review. He is also responsible for keeping track of deadlines and outstanding items to keep the team on track.

**Tony Halstead** (right) has a degree in Electrical Engineering and a professional background in research and defense technologies. His expertise includes circuit level design and high voltage systems. He's been letting the smoke out of ICs at home for over 10 years, so his real world experience will be invaluable. Tony has been the key person in charge of designing functionality and providing the electrical engineering experience required to get the circuit boards finalized. He's also been the lead in debugging the completed PCBs and designing the assembly process.

We've been working together for a couple years now on a variety of small projects, but this is our first Kickstarter! Together we have had a lot of success on our projects, each of our strengths filling in some of the key weaknesses of the other.
